# Implementation Plan: Hello World Baseline

**Branch**: `001-hello-world` | **Date**: 2025-11-11 | **Spec**: [specs/001-hello-world/spec.md](specs/001-hello-world/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-hello-world/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan is generated by `/speckit.plan` and follows the project constitution and Vue best practices.

## Summary

This feature delivers a minimal, production-grade Vue 3 application that displays "Hello World" on the main page, with all code and tests in TypeScript. Following the official Vue quickstart and community best practices. The goal is to verify the toolchain, test setup, and browser compatibility as a foundation for further development. It starts with running `npm create vue@latest` to scaffold a default project with test runners and deployment.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Vue 3.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue 3
**Storage**: N/A (no persistent storage required for baseline)
**Testing**: unit and E2E is setup using `npm create vue@latest` creating default project
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: Single web application (SPA)
**Performance Goals**: Instant load for "Hello World" baseline; <100ms render
**Constraints**: Must use TypeScript for all code/tests; follow Vue quickstart and best practices; browser-only
**Scale/Scope**: Minimal baseline (single component, single page, test setup)



## Constitution Check

**GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.**

- Browser-First Delivery: ✓ All features accessible in browser, no plugins/extensions required
- Developer-First Hosting: ✓ Static hosting, no proprietary dependencies
- Documentation of Manual Steps: ✓ Quickstart and setup steps will be documented
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): ✓ All code/test changes require tests first
- Use of Best Practices and Defaults: ✓ Follows Vue quickstart and community defaults
- Technology & Hosting Constraints: ✓ open source, browser-compatible

## Constitution-Mandated Workflow Steps

- **Peer Review**: All code changes MUST be peer reviewed before merge.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: CI pipeline MUST run all tests and lint checks before merge.
- **Semantic Versioning**: All releases MUST use semantic versioning.

These steps are enforced as part of the development workflow and are required for constitution compliance.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations. All requirements and best practices are followed for this feature.
